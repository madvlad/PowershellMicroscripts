# Powershell Microscripts
💻 Small powershell scripts for specific purposes 👨‍💻

These are all pretty narrow in their usefulness - but you might be able to find a little bit of utility from them.

### Atmospheromatic 🌴
[atmospheres.ps1](https://github.com/madvlad/PowershellMicroscripts/blob/master/atmospheres.ps1): Play an ambience atmosphere song in an invisible IE window. Add more youtube links to the script if you want different songs to play

[todays_lectionary.ps1](https://github.com/madvlad/PowershellMicroscripts/blob/master/todays_lectionary.ps1): Queries USCCB to get current day's readings and spits them out in the terminal

### Stupidoro 🍅

[pomodoro.ps1](https://github.com/madvlad/PowershellMicroscripts/blob/master/pomodoro.ps1): Stupid simple pomodoro timer. No extra unnecessary bloat. Throw it in a terminal and make it small
